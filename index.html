			<p>I was born and raised in San Francisco, where Silicon Valley is in reach. In my family, I am the most tech-savvy. In terms of coding, however, I'm just getting started with a few months of HTML experience from a class in a community college.</p>
			<p>I hope to be able to learn more about full-stack development as part of this coding bootcamp, so that I can be able to get a job doing this. The road of the coding bootcamp will be difficult, but perseverance will be key to my success. I hope to learn a great deal within these couple months.</p>
